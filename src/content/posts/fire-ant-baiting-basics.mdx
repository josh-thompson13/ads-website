Eradicating fire ants requires a repeatable program: survey the site, plan treatment windows, apply bait, and follow up.

## Survey and plan

Map nests and select a bait product suitable for the time of year. Avoid treatment during rain or when ants are inactive.

## Apply bait

Drone baiting enables even coverage across large areas quickly. Follow QLD guidance for compliance and safety.

## Follow-up

Reinspect and re-treat as needed to ensure long-term control.
