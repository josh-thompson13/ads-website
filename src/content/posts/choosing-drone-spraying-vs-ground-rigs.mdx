When deciding between drone spraying and ground rigs, consider your goals, terrain and weather windows.

## Access and compaction

Drones avoid rutting and compaction, especially in wet paddocks, steep or sensitive sites.

## Drift and efficacy

With the right nozzle and droplet size, drones achieve targeted coverage while minimising drift. Always follow product labels and stewardship guidance.

## Labour and speed

Drones reduce labour and can cover difficult terrain quickly without gates or washdown delays.
